# Personal-Portfolio
This project was created to test my CSS ability. The idea of the project is to create a hub
for all of my projects, that I will be making in the future. The links to the projects do not take you 
anywhere, as I have yet to complete other projects.
##Notes
This project thus far only contains CSS and HTML, as I learn more Javascript and frameworks, I will be improving
upon certain aspects, such as the functionality of this website.
